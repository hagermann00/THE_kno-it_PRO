## Statistical Benefits

MORE models = BETTER statistical analysis:

- **Larger sample size** → More reliable averages
- **Diverse training data** → Better outlier detection
- **Multiple perspectives** → Richer derivatives
- **Cost optimization** → More budget tiers

With 31+ models, Kno-It can:
- Run 10-model "Deep Dive" research

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (Now):** Keep current 4 providers (21 models)
**Phase 2:** Add Mistral (most compatible, OpenAI-like API)
**Phase 3:** Add Cohere
**Phase 4:** Add Perplexity (citation-focused)

This gives us a strong foundation to build the ResearchEngine on.
