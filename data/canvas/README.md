# Kno-It Canvas / Working Directory

This folder is designed to be a "Working Canvas" for the Kno-It engine.

## Usage (Planned Feature)
Drop `.txt`, `.md`, or `.pdf` files in here.

Future versions of Kno-It (`kb-it` module) will:
1.  **Ingest** these documents as context.
2.  **Vectorize** them for the local knowledge base.
3.  **Use** them to ground research (RAG) alongside web search.

For now, treat this as your "Inbox" for material you want the system to eventually learn from.
